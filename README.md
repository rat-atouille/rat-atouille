# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ #
I'm a computer science student at University of Western Ontario, passionate about building full stack applications and exploring the intersection of technology and design.

### My projects: ###
- **Cinephile:** A full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, and Express. Cinephile helps users organize and manage their movie lists, making it easy to discover new films and keep track of their favorites.
- **North America Word Chain:** A collaborative Java-based word game that challenges players to form word chains using geographical locations from the United States and Canada. With features like leaderboards, progress tracking, and save/load functionality, it's a fun and educational way to learn about geography while competing with friends.
- **Western GPA Calculator:** A user-friendly web application designed to assist Western University students in calculating their cumulative grade point average (cGPA) based on their percentage grades.
- **StudyMate:** A chrome extension intended to help students organize their study time and check their friends status as you study. Used MERN stack - Typescript React and Bootstrap with CSS for frontend, Node.js and Express for backend and MongoDB for database.

...And keep look out for more projects!

#### Technologies I'm familiar with: ###
