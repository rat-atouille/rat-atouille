## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ##
I'm a computer science student at University of Western Ontario, passionate about building innovative web applications and exploring the intersection of technology and design.

My projects:
Cinephile: 
- A full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, and Express. Cinephile helps users organize and manage their movie lists, making it easy to discover new films and keep track of their favorites.
- North America Word Chain: A collaborative Java game developed as part of a course group project. Players take turns forming word chains, connecting words by their last letter and first letter.
- Western GPA Calculator: A user-friendly web application designed to assist Western University students in calculating their cumulative grade point average (cGPA) based on their percentage grades.

...And keep look out for more projects! My goal is to create one project per month!

Technologies I'm familiar with:
Programming Languages: C, C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, SQL
Framework/Libraries: Bootstrap, React, Node.js, Express.js, Pandas, MySQL
Tools & Technologies: Git, Docker, Linux/Unix
